# 🧠 QA System for Computer Science Experts

A domain-specific **Question Answering (QA) system** designed to serve Computer Science experts with in-depth, citation-backed answers. This system leverages **state-of-the-art LLMs** with a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipeline, integrating **semantic search** over curated academic documents.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![System Architecture](./system_architecture.png)

> The pipeline integrates **vector-based retrieval (Milvus)** with **Meta's LLaMA3 7B** to generate accurate answers. Users query the system through an intuitive Gradio interface.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant academic content using embeddings from `Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5`
- 🧠 **LLM Reasoning**: Uses `LLaMA3 7B` to answer questions based on retrieved documents
- 📎 **Source Citation**: Each answer includes links to relevant academic papers (OpenAlex or other sources)
- ⚡ **Gradio UI**: Clean and interactive web interface for real-time QA
- 🧾 **Trusted Data**: Data sourced from OpenAlex and authoritative CS textbooks

## 🚀 How to Run

> Ensure you have Python ≥ 3.8 and Jupyter installed. Run cells **sequentially from top to bottom** in each notebook.

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Start Milvus server**
   You can either use Docker or follow Milvus installation guide:
   [https://milvus.io/docs/install\_standalone-docker.md](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md)

3. **Run Notebooks**

* `embed.ipynb`:
  ⮕ Loads documents → generates embeddings → inserts into Milvus

* `LLM_RAG.ipynb`:
  ⮕ Accepts user query → retrieves documents → generates answer using LLaMA3 7B → returns detailed answer with source links

* `test.ipynb`:
  ⮕ Try out your queries with various edge cases

## 🧪 Example Output

**Input**:

> *"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"*

**Output**:

> Supervised learning relies on labeled data, where each input has a corresponding output label. In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and attempts to discover hidden patterns.

## 📚 Data Sources

All knowledge is extracted from trustworthy CS-related resources:

* ✅ Textbooks from top universities (e.g., MIT, Stanford)
* ✅ OpenAlex metadata ([https://openalex.org/](https://openalex.org/))
* ✅ Peer-reviewed conference papers (NeurIPS, ACL, CVPR...)

Documents are:

* Cleaned & preprocessed
* Embedded with `gte-large-en-v1.5`
* Stored in `Milvus` for efficient retrieval

## 📈 Potential Improvements

* [ ] Integrate LangChain or Haystack for modularity
* [ ] Extend citation support to BibTeX/APA formats
* [ ] Improve UI with user feedback and answer ratings
* [ ] Deploy backend API with FastAPI or Flask
